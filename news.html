                        Hello fellow players! We know that you really love to play our games, but we are sorry to announce this.
                        As the title suggests, we are going to have a routine maintenance in such a near time, which is at 28 March of this glorius year!
                        We apologize for the sudden announcement and for the unconvinience of this maintenance. We are hoping we'll be able to serve
                        you better in the future. Stay tuned!

                        War Greymon is a Dragon Man Digimon whose name and design are derived 
                        from "War Greymon". The strongest dragon warrior, with a body clad in 
                        armor of the super-metal "Chrome Digizoid", it is the ultimate form of 
                        Greymon-species Digimon. Though it differs from the gigantic figure seen 
                        in Greymon-species Digimon, and has the form of a Man-type, it has rapidly 
                        improved its speed and power, and it is likely impossible to defeat 
                        it with the attacks of an Ultimate Digimon. The "Dramon Killers" equipped
                        to both of ith arms exhibit immense power against Dramon-species Digimon,
                        while simultaneously being a two edged sword that completely endangers itself. 
                        Also, when the shells equipped on its back unite into one, the become 
                        the "Brave Shield", which is the strongest and toughest shield. It is 
                        said that the moment that a true hero, among all the mighty that have been 
                        through many battles, awakens to its own mission, it Digivolves into WarGreymon.
                        It bears the Crest of Courage on the Brave Shield.

                        Vikemon is a Beast Man Digimon whose name and design are derived from 
                        the Viking Berserker. It is a Mega Digimon which governs the freezing
                        lands of the permafrost, where nothing ever thaws. Its fur has become
                        like ice crystals, and is said to be as hard as Chrome Digizoid. With
                        the morning star "Mj√∂llnir" it carries on its back, it can annihilate
                        a mountain in one swing, distorting space itself. It manages the Ikkakumon 
                        and Zudomon corps, and although in the midst of battle it appears as
                        a heartless berserker, it shows a face of great compassion for its subordinates.
